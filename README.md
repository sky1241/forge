# forge

Pytest regression shield with predictive analytics for Python repos. Single-file, **stdlib-only** runtime (pytest is the only required dep at run time).

```bash
pip install forge-shield
forge --init    # baseline current test suite
forge           # detect regressions vs baseline
forge --carmack # rank files by predicted defect risk
```

## What it does

- **Baseline & regression detection** — snapshots your pytest results, flags any test that goes from pass to fail.
- **Flaky test detection** — re-runs failures, classifies flaky vs deterministic.
- **Defect-prone file ranking** (`--carmack`) — combines git churn, import coupling and test-failure history into a per-file risk score.
- **Test generation** (`--gen-props`) — emits Hypothesis property tests for pure functions, with a destructive-side-effect AST guard so it never runs `gen_props` on code that writes files or shells out.
- **Mutation testing** (`--mutate`) — pure-Python AST mutator, no `mutmut` install needed.
- **Fault localization** (`--locate`) — Ochiai SBFL formula over `coverage.py` data.
- **Delta debugging** (`--minimize`) — ddmin (Zeller 2002) to shrink failing inputs.

## What's actually inside

Algorithms are implemented from the papers, not wrapped from sklearn/scipy/networkx.

| Algorithm | Implementation | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Louvain community detection | greedy modularity gain, pure Python | Blondel et al. 2008 |
| Newman-Girvan modularity Q | `(1/2m)·Σ[A_ij − k_i·k_j/2m]·δ` | Newman & Girvan 2004 |
| Kaplan-Meier survival | right-censoring, ties handled events-first | Kaplan & Meier 1958 |
| Adaptive Kalman filter | innovation-based variance re-estimation | Mehra 1970 (style) |
| Haar wavelet | textbook avg/diff, padded to power of 2 | — |
| DTW | O(n·m) DP matrix | Sakoe & Chiba 1978 |
| Ochiai SBFL | `failed / sqrt(totalFailed × (passed+failed))` | Abreu et al. 2007 |
| ddmin | unresolved-aware delta debugging | Zeller & Hildebrandt 2002 |

Validation tests pin known results: Karate Club graph Q ∈ [0.38, 0.45] (Zachary 1977), Kaplan-Meier hand-checked survival probabilities, two-cliques+bridge community split.

## Honest limits

- The composite `carmack_score` weights (kalman 0.25, wavelet 0.20, crash 0.25, coupling 0.15, churn 0.15) are **heuristic, not calibrated against a labelled dataset**. Use it as a ranking signal, not a probability.
- The "adaptive Kalman" is innovation-based variance re-estimation, not full Shumway-Stoffer EM with RTS smoother.
- Coverage of forge's own CLI subcommands is partial — the math primitives are well tested, the orchestration code is not.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.10
- pytest (required at runtime, not bundled)
- `coverage`, `hypothesis`, `mutmut` only needed for the corresponding subcommands

Cross-platform: macOS / Linux / Windows. All subprocess calls go through `sys.executable -m pytest` and use UTF-8 with `errors=replace`.
